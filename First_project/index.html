        <h2> What is this game about?</H2>
        <P> This is a 2D platform game about a plumber who has to rescue a princess (the Princess Toadstool) from a dragon (Bowser). he has to go through 
            8 different worlds, defeating different enemies, going through different levels and castles, and using exciting power-ups that make the game so much more fun.
        There is also a 2 player mode, but it is not like the ones we have today where both players can play at the same time, it is more like a "wait for your turn" type of thing, because after you clear one level, it's the next player's turn to play. Despite that, I strongly recommend this game to anyone. </P>
