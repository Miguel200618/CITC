    <h2>What This Chatbot Does</h2>
    <p>This AI assistant was built to handle common real estate questions like home estimates, location services, and agent availability. It's designed to support both customers looking for quick answers and businesses that need 24/7 automation for lead generation.</p>
    <p>When a user interacts with the chatbot, it responds with helpful information in real-time, removing the need for a human agent in many situations. This helps businesses serve more customers faster while maintaining a professional experience.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The assistant runs on a structured knowledge base. Each common question and variation is mapped to a specific response. This ensures the chatbot understands what users mean even if they phrase things differently. This logic was implemented using a no-code AI design platform that powers the chatbot engine you see on the demo page.</p>
    <p>Natural language processing allows it to interpret user intent, while a flow-based architecture ensures the conversation follows logical, guided paths. This makes it both interactive and reliable, whether the user is on a mobile device or desktop.</p>

        <h2> How it is built</h2>
    <p>This demo is built with a software as a service called Voice Flow. This website simplifies everything to the point where you don't need to know any coding language. All you need is a little understanding in logic and imagination.</p>
    <p>You can build them by dragging nodes and connecting them to each other with arrows. There are many different types of nodes with their own functionality, there are text nodes, choice nodes condition nodes, action nodes and capture nodes, as well as a new feature called agent.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text nodes: Send messages or responses to the user</li>
        <li>Choice nodes: Options for the user to click from (similar to "IF" statements)</li>
        <li>Condition nodes: Make desicions based on user input or variables.</li>
        <li>Action nodes: Perform specific actions, such as API calls or calculations</li>
        <li>Capture nodes: Stores users inputs to store in variables (such as text and numbers).</li>
    </ul>
